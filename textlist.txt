Which of the following is an AWS Cloud architecture design principle?
A. Implement single points of failure.
B. Implement loose coupling.
C. Implement monolithic design.
D. Implement vertical scaling.
Correct Answer: B
Loose coupling between services can also be done through asynchronous integration. It involves one component that generates events and
another that consumes them. The two components do not integrate through direct point-to-point interaction, but usually through an
intermediate durable storage layer. This approach decouples the two components and introduces additional resiliency. So, for example, if a
process that is reading messages from the queue fails, messages can still be added to the queue to be processed when the system recovers.

Question #103
Which of the following security measures protect access to an AWS account? (Choose two.)
A. Enable AWS CloudTrail.
B. Grant least privilege access to IAM users.
C. Create one IAM user and share with many developers and users.
D. Enable Amazon CloudFront.
E. Activate multi-factor authentication (MFA) for privileged users.
Correct Answer: BE
If you decided to create service accounts (that is, accounts used for programmatic access by applications running outside of the AWS
environment) and generate access keys for them, you should create a dedicated service account for each use case. This will allow you to
restrict the associated policy to only the permissions needed for the particular use case, limiting the blast radius if the credentials are
compromised. For example, if a monitoring tool and a release management tool both require access to your AWS environment, create two
separate service accounts with two separate policies that define the minimum set of permissions for each tool.

D. Colocation
E. Capital expenses
Correct Answer: BC
The most celebrated benefit of AWS cloud is elasticity since you can expand the services when you experience more traffic.
Agile developments in AWS Cloud through strategies are day by day becoming more established within the enterprises across the world. With
so much improvement and call for optimization in the cloud, it is necessary that these strategies get established from the ground up within the
organizations. It is highly important as already enterprises have a lot of bequest, politics and hierarchies which act as barriers in their
businesses.

Question #137
What are the multiple, isolated locations within an AWS Region that are connected by low-latency networks called?
A. AWS Direct Connects
B. Amazon VPCs
C. Edge locations
D. Availability Zones
Correct Answer: D
Each Region is completely independent. Each Availability Zone is isolated, but the Availability Zones in a Region are connected through low-
latency links. A Local
Zone is an AWS infrastructure deployment that places select services closer to your end users. A Local Zone is an extension of a Region that is
in a different location from your Region. It provides a high-bandwidth backbone to the AWS infrastructure and is ideal for latency-sensitive
applications, for example machine learning.

Question #144
When is it beneficial for a company to use a Spot Instance?
A. When there is fiexibility in when an application needs to run.
B. When there are mission-critical workloads.
C. When dedicated capacity is needed.
D. When an instance should not be stopped.
Correct Answer: A
The key to understanding spot instances is to look at the way that cloud service providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) operate. Cloud
service providers invest in hardware resources and then release those resources (often on a per-hour basis) to subscribers. One of the
problems with this business model, however, is that at any given time, there are likely to be compute resources that are not being utilized. These
resources represent hardware capacity that AWS has paid for but are sitting idle, and not making AWS any money at the moment.
Rather than allowing these computing resources to go to waste, AWS offers them at a substantially discounted rate, with the understanding that
if someone needs those resources for running a normal EC2 instance, that instance will take priority over spot instances that are using the
hardware resources at a discounted rate.
In fact, spot instances will be stopped if the resources are needed elsewhere.

Question #145
A company is considering moving its on-premises data center to AWS.
What factors should be included in doing a Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) analysis? (Choose two.)
A. Amazon EC2 instance availability
B. Power consumption of the data center
C. Labor costs to replace old servers
D. Application developer time
E. Database engine capacity
Correct Answer: BC
Question #146
How does AWS charge for AWS Lambda?
A. Users bid on the maximum price they are willing to pay per hour.
B. Users choose a 1-, 3- or 5-year upfront payment term.
C. Users pay for the required permanent storage on a file system or in a database.
D. Users pay based on the number of requests and consumed compute resources.
Correct Answer: D
AWS Lambda is charging its users by the number of requests for their functions and by the duration, which is the time the code needs to
execute. When code starts running in response to an event, AWS Lambda counts a request. It will charge the total number of requests across all
of the functions used. Duration is calculated by the time when your code started executing until it returns or until it is terminated, rounded up
near to 100ms. The AWS Lambda pricing depends on the amount of memory that the user used to allocate to the function.
Reference:
https://dashbird.io/blog/aws-lambda-pricing-model-explained/
Question #147
What function do security groups serve related to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance security?
A. Act as a virtual firewall for the Amazon EC2 instance.
B. Secure AWS user accounts with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies.
C. Provide DDoS protection with AWS Shield.
D. Use Amazon CloudFront to protect the Amazon EC2 instance.
Correct Answer: A
AWS Security Groups act like a firewall for your Amazon EC2 instances controlling both inbound and outbound traffic. When you launch an
instance on Amazon
EC2, you need to assign it to a particular security group.
After that, you can set up ports and protocols, which remain open for users and computers over the internet.
AWS Security Groups are very fiexible. You can use the default security group and still customize it according to your liking (although we
donג€™t recommend this practice because groups should be named according to their purpose.) Or you can create a security group that you
want for your specific applications. To do this, you can write the corresponding code or use the Amazon EC2 console to make the process
easier.

Question #148
Which disaster recovery scenario offers the lowest probability of down time?
A. Backup and restore
B. Pilot light
C. Warm standby
D. Multi-site active-active
Correct Answer: D
✑ Backup and Restore: a simple, straightforward, cost-effective method that backs up and restores data as needed. Keep in mind that because
none of your data is on standby, this method, while cheap, can be quite time-consuming.
✑ Pilot Light: This method keeps critical applications and data at the ready so that it can be quickly retrieved if needed.
✑ Warm Standby: This method keeps a duplicate version of your businessג€™ core elements running on standby at all times, which makes for a
little downtime and an almost seamless transition.
✑ Multi-Site Solution: Also known as a Hot Standby, this method fully replicates your companyג€™s data/applications between two or more
active locations and splits your traffic/usage between them. If a disaster strikes, everything is simply rerouted to the unaffected area, which
means youג€™ll suffer almost zero downtime. However, by running two separate environments simultaneously, you will obviously incur much
higher costs.

Question #150
Which of the following provides the ability to share the cost benefits of Reserved Instances across AWS accounts?
A. AWS Cost Explorer between AWS accounts
B. Linked accounts and consolidated billing
C. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Reserved Instance Utilization Report
D. Amazon EC2 Instance Usage Report between AWS accounts
Correct Answer: B
The way that Reserved Instance discounts apply to accounts in an organization's consolidated billing family depends on whether Reserved
Instance sharing is turned on or off for the account. By default, Reserved Instance sharing for all accounts in an organization is turned on. You
can change this setting by Turning Off
Reserved Instance Sharing for an account.
The capacity reservation for a Reserved Instance applies only to the account the Reserved Instance was purchased on, regardless of whether
Reserved Instance sharing is turned on or off.

Question #164
Which architectural principle is used when deploying an Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) instance in Multiple Availability Zone
mode?
A. Implement loose coupling.
B. Design for failure.
C. Automate everything that can be automated.
D. Use services, not servers.
Correct Answer: B
Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments provide enhanced availability and durability for Database (DB) Instances, making them a natural fit for
production database workloads. When you provision a Multi-AZ DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and
synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). Each AZ runs on its own physically distinct,
independent infrastructure, and is engineered to be highly reliable. In case of an infrastructure failure, Amazon RDS performs an automatic
failover to the standby (or to a read replica in the case of Amazon Aurora), so that you can resume database operations as soon as the failover
is complete. Since the endpoint for your DB Instance remains the same after a failover, your application can resume database operation without
the need for manual administrative intervention.

Question #166
What is a benefit of loose coupling as a principle of cloud architecture design?
A. It facilitates low-latency request handling.
B. It allows applications to have dependent workfiows.
C. It prevents cascading failures between different components.
D. It allows companies to focus on their physical data center operations.
Correct Answer: C
IT systems should ideally be designed in a way that reduces inter-dependencies. Your components need to be loosely coupled to avoid changes
or failure in one of the components from affecting others.
Your infrastructure also needs to have well defined interfaces that allow the various components to interact with each other only through
specific, technology- agnostic interfaces. Modifying any underlying operations without affecting other components should be made possible.

Question #169
How can a customer increase security to AWS account logons? (Choose two.)
A. Configure AWS Certificate Manager
B. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
C. Use Amazon Cognito to manage access
D. Configure a strong password policy
E. Enable AWS Organizations
Correct Answer: BC
Your root account should always be protected by Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). This additional layer of security helps protect against
unauthorized logins to your account by requiring two factors: something you know (a password) and something you have (for example, an MFA
device). AWS supports virtual and hardware MFA devices and U2F security keys.
Cognito can be used as an Identity Provider (IdP), where it stores and maintains users and credentials securely for your applications, or it can
be integrated with
OpenID Connect, SAML, and other popular web identity providers like Amazon.com.
Using Amazon Cognito, you can generate temporary access credentials for your clients to access AWS services, eliminating the need to store
long-term credentials in client applications.

Moving data to the cloud is not quite as simple as fiipping a switch. For companies that have managed their own data centers or server rooms
for decades, there are a few steps to consider -- and itג€™s not always wise to pull the plug on an internal infrastructure quite so quickly. If a
startup uses on-premise business servers and then experiences unexpected growth, abandoning those servers doesnג€™t make sense (even if
the long-term plan is to do exactly that).
AWS Storage Gateway is a way to bridge this gap for companies of any size. Itג€™s a hybrid storage option that connects on-premise storage
including age-old tape backup systems to the cloud in a way that also provides one console to access all storage configurations.

Which of the AWS global infrastructure is used to cache copies of content for faster delivery to users across the globe?
A. AWS Regions
B. Availability Zones
C. Edge locations
D. Data centers
Correct Answer: C
When your web traffic is geo-dispersed, itג€™s not always feasible and certainly not cost effective to replicate your entire infrastructure across
the globe. A CDN provides you the ability to utilize its global network of edge locations to deliver a cached copy of web content such as videos,
webpages, images and so on to your customers. To reduce response time, the CDN utilizes the nearest edge location to the customer or
originating request location in order to reduce the response time. Throughput is dramatically increased given that the web assets are delivered
from cache. For dynamic data, many CDNs can be configured to retrieve data from the origin servers.
